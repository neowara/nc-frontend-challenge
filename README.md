# Natural Cycles Frontend Challenge - Angular Countdown Timer

A professionally crafted Angular countdown timer application demonstrating modern web development practices, clean code architecture, and production-ready styling.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy & Technical Approach

This project showcases a **clean, modern approach** to Angular development with emphasis on:

### **Modern CSS Architecture**
- **Josh Comeau's Modern CSS Reset**: Implemented comprehensive CSS reset for consistent cross-browser behavior
- **CSS Grid Layout**: Clean, flexible layout system replacing complex positioning
- **Fluid Typography**: `clamp()` functions for optimal text scaling across all devices
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Centralized design tokens for maintainable theming
- **Container Queries**: Future-proof responsive design patterns

### **Professional Styling Strategy**
- **Glass Morphism Design**: Modern frosted glass effects with backdrop filters
- **Stable Layout System**: Prevents text jumping using `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`
- **Animated Background**: Subtle floating dot pattern inspired by Natural Cycles branding
- **Mobile-First Responsive**: Optimized for all screen sizes with proper touch targets
- **Accessibility-First**: WCAG compliant contrast ratios and semantic HTML structure

### **Angular Best Practices**
- **Signals-Based Architecture**: Leveraging Angular's modern reactive primitives
- **Standalone Components**: Clean, modular architecture without NgModules
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enhanced type safety and developer experience
- **Component Communication**: Proper input/output patterns with type safety
- **Performance Optimization**: Computed signals for efficient reactive updates

## ✨ Key Features

### **Countdown Timer**

- Displays format: "25 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes, 45 seconds"
- Grouped number-unit pairs for better readability
- Stable text layout preventing visual jumps
- Graceful handling of past dates and edge cases

### **Event Form**
- Clean, modern glass morphism design
- Real-time input validation and feedback
- Accessible form controls with proper labeling
- Responsive layout adapting to screen size
- Data persistence via localStorage

### **Visual Design**
- **Natural Cycles Brand Colors**: Purple, pink, and coral gradient schemes
- **Animated Dotted Background**: Subtle floating animation for visual appeal
- **Professional Typography**: Carefully chosen font hierarchy and spacing
- **Smooth Transitions**: Polished micro-interactions throughout the interface
